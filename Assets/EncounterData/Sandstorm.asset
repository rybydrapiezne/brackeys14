      just gained."

        By the time the storm fades, the group is battered and exhausted, and one
        of your men has been lost to the desert\u2019s fury. Looking at how reckless
        this decision was, the loss of only one person is a surprisingly good result."
      failureText: The storm tears into you with merciless force. When the sands
        finally settle, three of your men lie buried, and the survivors stumble onward

      successText: You lunge at bandits with your weapons in hands. Steel clashes
        in the narrow pass. They fire at once from their loaded crossbows. One of
        the bolts kills one of you. Yet against the odds, you overpower the ambushers
        and scatter them into the wilderness. Among their fallen you find water,
        gear, and a handful of valuables.
      failureText: 'FAILURE: You are not fast enough to evade bolts flying at you.
        As two of your men  immediately fall to the ground, scatter and quickly retreat.
        In chaos bandits grab as much of valuables as they can and run away.
