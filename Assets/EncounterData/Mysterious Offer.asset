  description: "As night falls, a cloaked figure appears from nowhere and joins your
    campfire. The figure has no face. When you look at it, all you see is absolute
    darkness. However their voice is smooth as silk: \u201CI can give you what you
    desperately lack. Supplies, riches, or tools \u2014 take your pick. But everything
    comes at a price\u2026 one you will pay when the journey nears its end.\u201D"
