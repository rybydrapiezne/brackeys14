  description: " It seems like your journey is slowly coming to the end. You remind
    yourself that you once signed a contract, but haven\u2019t paid it off yet. Right
    on cue the faceless cloaked figure returns. The voice that was once so smooth
    the first time you met, now has turned cold and cruel: \u201CThe time has come.
    You\u2019ve taken what was offered \u2014 now the price must be paid. There is
    no escape. Give me 5 souls. And I\u2019ll be satisfied.\u201D"

    resultText: "As you say yes, one by one, five of your companions collapse, their
      faces pale and lifeless. The figure says \u201CIt was a pleasure doing business
      with you\u201D. You can\u2019t see the face but it laughs nonetheless, then
      fades into shadows."
