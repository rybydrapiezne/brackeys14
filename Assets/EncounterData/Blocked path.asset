        in the narrow pass. They fire at once from their loaded crossbows. One of
        the bolts kills one of you. Yet against the odds, you overpower the ambushers
        and scatter them into the wilderness. Among their fallen you find water,
        gear, and a handful of valuables.

        As two of your men  immediately fall to the ground, scatter and quickly retreat.
        In chaos bandits grab as much of valuables as they can and run away.
