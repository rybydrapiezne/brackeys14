      successText: With rope, tools, and careful effort, you patch the hull just
        enough to keep it afloat. As long as you move along the river, you travel
        much faster. You feel it gives you an advantage over the ones chasing you.
      failureText: Despite your best efforts, the barge creaks and breaks down. You
        wasted a lot of time and it was all for nothing. It's the perfect opportunity
        for the ones chasing you to catch up.
